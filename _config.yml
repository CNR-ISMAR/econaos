  Open Science principles are more and more pervasive in a scientist's life.
  European Union and other important international organisations are
  progressively recognising the importance of open science (that includes
  open source, open data, open access and so on). The Institute for Marine 
  Science at the Italian National Council of Research makes part of a larger
  network of Long Term Ecological Data, and provides a great variety of 
  oceanographic data. We focus on North Adriatic area and our aim is to 
  implement a strategy to open all the lifecycle of our research: starting 
  from the collection of data, to the publication of results. In this context, 
  the blog wants to be a newsletter to keep us and you all update about our
  activities and ideas. Stay tuned!

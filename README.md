EcoNÃ€OS is a CNR-ISMAR project aimed to bring Open Science in marine ecology. The project involves abiotic, phito and zooplancton data and, more specifically, we want to open the entire research project lifecycle: research ideas, data, outputs, reviews etc. The blog helps disseminate events, results and phylosophy behind the project.

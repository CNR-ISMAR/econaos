Our project has been selected to speak about Open Science, Open Access and alternative forms of knowledge sharing ina  workshop organized at the
[Universit√† Milano Bicocca] [unimib] (Milan, Italy) by the [Successione Ecologica] [se] association.

The workshop has seen different interventions regarding different experiences in the field of ecology data and knowledge sharing in different topics. Also application supporting ecology have been represented (citizen science and spatial analysis).

The introductive phase of the day has been held by [Elena Giglia] [eg]. Elena is a researcher at the University of Torino (responsible for bibliotecary service) and she is from long time involved at national and international level in dissemination actions on the themes of Open Science principles applications to scientific literature and products.

Our work was well inserted into the interventions panel since it involved scientists from different research fileds and it is able to find and use different technologies and alternative means for sharing science products.

At this [link] [slides] it is possible to find the slides of our intervention.

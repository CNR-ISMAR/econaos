Announcement!


EcoNÀOS project will join the [Italian ecological society meeting][ecologia] that will take place the 12th-15th September 2017 in Naples.
This year the theme will be "Ecological research in a changing world" and, even if our proejct is not a pure ecological theme, we believe it could well represent an example of the "change" that Open Science could lead to marine ecological world.

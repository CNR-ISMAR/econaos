We finally published our complete database on [DEIMS-SDR] [deims] platform. The database is composed by observations (collected between 1965 and 2015) of abiotic, phyto and zooplankton parameters in the LTER site [IT-12 (Northern Adriatic Sea)] [it12]. 

It is composed by more than 100000 observations collected during cruises along the Northern Adriatic Sea. It counts 21 parameters abiotic (just as temperature, oxygen content, salinity etc.), phyto- and zooplankton and each observation is referred both in space (latitude, longitude, depth) and time (date and time).

After a preliminary operation of data quality control and correction, the database has been published on DEIMS-SDR platform, which is the offical system for information management and data sites registry of [LTER International] [ilter]y. DEIMS-SDR has recently set up a service that allows to associate a PID (Persisten Indexed Identifier) of type [Handle] [handle] (technology also used by DOI - Digital Object Identifier) to the database. It is also allowed to choose  a specific license for your data from the whole available panorama. The database uploaded in DEIMS is available also on [B2Share] [b2share] catalogs and, from there, in [EUDAT] [eudat] and [GEOSS] [geoss] catalogs. All of this was possible thanks to an agreement between [eLTER] [elter] and the Collaborative Data Infrastructure EUDAT.

The publication of data in this way is in line with the principles of [FAIRness] [fairness] in research data management: data are Findable (since they are indexed by the main search engines), Accessible (anyone can view and download the entire database), Interoperable (the set up services are multiplatform), Reusable (thanks tot he specific liberal license chosen for data). Moreover, a datapaper is under redaction, with the aim to better explain data and increment metadata quantity and quality.

The database is released under [CC-BY] [ccby] license and it is available for download at the following [link] [link].

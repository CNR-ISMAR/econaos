[IRCDL conference] [conference] took place in Pisa (Italy) at the CNR Institute for Sciences and Technologies for the Information "A. Faedo" ([ISTI] [isti]), january 31st and February 1st, 2019. The conference is, from a quite long time, a reference point at national and international level for people working on library science and interested, among other things, in data science and research data citation. In this edition, the focus was on open science, multiple forms of research products and outcomes and how library science can support research (open data, open access, open policies etc.).

Our project was presented during the session named "Open Science publishing and scientific workflows". In this case, we focused on the conception of a reserach process as a workflow that previews, at each step, the application of Open Science principles. In this occasion a new version of the Open Scientific Lifecycle model has been created reporting the application of the general principles, [outlined at the beginning of the project] [primopost], applied to marine Long Term Ecological data, related to [Northern Adratic Sea] [NAS] zone.

[Slides] [slides] from our talk are available in Zenodo and during the intervention we evidenced the opening actions took and their innovation degree respect to the actual practices. Particular attention is then reserved to ongoing and future actions:

1. dissemination actions;
2. dynamic datasets citation;
3. writing of guidelines.

It has been very interesting for our work the intervention of the keynote speaker [Prof. Susan B. Davidson] [psbd], from the University of Pennsylvaina, regarding the creation of a system for dynamic dataset citation. Her work focuses on big data, data citation and data curation.

At the end of the first day of conference a panel discussion took also place in order to report some significant experiences in open science, assess and discuss the italian situation of "science opening".
